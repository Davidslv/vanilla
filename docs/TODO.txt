Game Programming Patterns Refactoring Plan
========================================

1. Component Pattern
-------------------
Current Issue:
- Units (Player, Monster) have too many responsibilities
- Movement, Combat, Stats are all tightly coupled
- Hard to add new behaviors or modify existing ones

Solution:
- Create separate components:
  * MovementComponent
  * CombatComponent
  * StatsComponent
  * InventoryComponent
- Entities (Player, Monster) become containers for components
- Makes it easier to:
  * Add new entity types by combining components
  * Modify behavior by swapping components
  * Test components in isolation

2. Observer Pattern
------------------
Current Issue:
- Direct coupling between actions and their effects
- Hard to add new reactions to events
- Difficult to track game state changes

Solution:
- Create an event system for:
  * Movement events (success, failure, collision)
  * Combat events (attack, damage, death)
  * Game state events (level change, item pickup)
- Benefits:
  * Easy to add new event listeners
  * Better debugging (can log all events)
  * Simpler testing
  * Support for achievements/quests

3. State Pattern
---------------
Current Issue:
- Game states (exploring, combat, inventory) are implicit
- State transitions are scattered
- Hard to add new states

Solution:
- Create explicit game states:
  * ExploringState
  * CombatState
  * InventoryState
  * GameOverState
- Benefits:
  * Clear state transitions
  * State-specific input handling
  * Easier to add new states
  * Better UI context management

4. Command Pattern Enhancement
----------------------------
Current Issue:
- Commands are fire-and-forget
- No history of actions
- Can't implement undo/redo

Solution:
- Enhance Command pattern:
  * Make commands recordable
  * Add undo capability
  * Store command history
- Benefits:
  * Replay support
  * Undo/redo functionality
  * Better debugging
  * Could add save/load feature

5. Update Method Pattern
-----------------------
Current Issue:
- No clear game loop
- Time-based events are difficult
- Would be hard to add AI or animations

Solution:
- Implement proper game loop
- Add update method to entities/components
- Benefits:
  * Support for AI behaviors
  * Time-based events
  * Animations
  * Better performance control

Implementation Priority
=====================
1. Component Pattern
   - Most fundamental change
   - Makes other patterns easier to implement
   - Start with MovementComponent

2. Observer Pattern
   - Helps decouple existing code
   - Makes testing easier
   - Enables better debugging

3. State Pattern
   - Clarifies game flow
   - Makes UI more manageable
   - Improves user experience

4. Command Pattern Enhancement
   - Adds useful features
   - Improves debugging
   - Enables save/load

5. Update Method Pattern
   - Foundation for future features
   - Add when needed for AI/animations

Next Steps
==========
1. Create MovementComponent
   - Move movement logic from Movement module
   - Add component base class
   - Update Unit class to use components

2. Add EventManager
   - Create basic event system
   - Convert direct calls to events
   - Add logging for debugging

3. Create GameState base class
   - Start with ExploringState
   - Move relevant logic from main loop
   - Add state transitions

Notes
=====
- Keep existing functionality while refactoring
- Add tests for new components/systems
- Document pattern usage for future contributors
- Consider performance implications
- Maintain roguelike game feel
