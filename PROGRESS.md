# Progress Report

## Changes Made So Far

### 1. Component System Refactoring
- Updated `BaseComponent` to initialize without requiring an entity parameter
- Modified all component classes to follow the new initialization pattern:
  - `StatsComponent`
  - `CombatComponent`
  - `MovementComponent`
  - `TransformComponent`
- Each component now calls `super()` without parameters and sets `@entity = entity` manually

### 2. System Initialization Fixes
- Fixed `InputSystem` initialization to properly handle world and player parameters
- Updated `MessageSystem` to correctly initialize with world parameter
- Both systems now properly call `super()` without parameters and set their instance variables

### 3. Command System Updates
- Modified `BaseCommand` to require both world and entity parameters
- Updated `MovementCommand` to handle world parameter in initialization
- Attempted to fix level transition logic in `MovementCommand`

## Current Issues

1. **Level Transition Bug**
   - Player disappears when moving to stairs
   - Grid transition not working correctly
   - Player position not properly maintained

2. **Event System Issues**
   - Event emission during level transition not working properly
   - Need to verify event manager integration

## Next Steps

### 1. Fix Level Transition
- Review `TransformComponent#update_grid` implementation
- Ensure proper grid state management during transition
- Verify player position handling
- Add logging for debugging grid state changes

### 2. Improve Event System
- Review event manager initialization
- Add proper event handlers for level transition
- Implement event logging for debugging

### 3. Add Testing Infrastructure
- Create comprehensive test suite
- Add test cases for:
  - Component initialization
  - System interactions
  - Level transitions
  - Event handling

### 4. Code Organization
- Organize changes into logical commits
- Add proper documentation
- Create test setup guide

## Technical Debt
1. Need proper version control strategy
2. Missing test coverage
3. Incomplete documentation
4. No clear contribution guidelines

## Questions to Address
1. How should grid state be preserved during level transition?
2. What's the proper way to handle player position in new levels?
3. How should events be structured for level transitions?
4. What testing strategy should be implemented?
